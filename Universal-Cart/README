HOW TO USE AS GOOGLE EXTENSION:

1) Inside the folder you should have these files with the code I provided:
manifest.json
popup/ (folder)
   popup.html
   popup.css
   popup.js
content.js
background.js
icons/ (folder with sample icon files)

2) Load the Extension in Chrome
Open Chrome and go to:
chrome://extensions

Enable Developer Mode (toggle in top-right corner)

Click "Load unpacked" button

Select your universal-cart folder

The extension will now appear in your extensions list and is now usable!

3) To use it you simply go to a product on an online website and copy and URL in google at the top,
you then paste it in and it should appear in the cart showing the image, price, title, and cilckable URL.

*This is still a work in progress and some sites may not work due to having strict privacy settings like Amazon.
