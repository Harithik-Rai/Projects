# Predicting Exam Performance from Wearable Stress Signals
Dataset from: https://physionet.org/content/wearable-exam-stress/1.0.0/

## Overview
This project investigates whether physiological stress signals captured by wearable devices
can predict cognitive performance during real-world exam settings.

Using heart rate, electrodermal activity, skin temperature, and motion data collected across
multiple exam sessions, I model exam scores as a continuous outcome and analyze which stress
patterns are most predictive of performance.

## Dataset
Wearable Exam Stress Dataset (PhysioNet):
- Multimodal wearable sensor data
- Three exam sessions per participant
- Ground-truth exam grades

## Objectives
- Extract interpretable temporal features from physiological signals
- Build regression models to predict exam performance
- Identify physiological patterns associated with high and low performance

## Methods
- Feature engineering on time-series signals
- Regularized linear regression and tree-based models
- Cross-validation and error analysis

## Results
(Added after modeling)

## Key Insights
(Added after analysis)
